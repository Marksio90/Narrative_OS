# Narrative OS - MVP Status Report

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-07
**Branch:** `claude/story-bible-timeline-BzGDy`
**Status:** 🟢 **MVP Backend Complete - Ready for Testing**

---

## 🎯 Vision Recap

**Narrative OS** fills a market gap by providing **structural consistency tools** that go beyond basic story bibles:

### What Makes Us Different:
- **Canon Contracts** - Hard consistency rules AI cannot break
- **Promise/Payoff Ledger** - Automatic narrative promise tracking
- **Writers' Room QC** - Multi-agent quality validation
- **Scene-by-Scene Pipeline** - Deterministic prose generation
- **Git-like Versioning** - Full canon history and rollback

### Target Market:
Fantasy/Thriller authors writing **300-600 page novels** or **series** who:
- Lose consistency over long distances
- Struggle with structure (acts, turning points)
- Have chaotic world bibles
- Want AI as editorial team, not text generator

---

## ✅ Implemented Features (MVP Backend)

### 1. **Canon System** - Source of Truth

**9 Core Entity Types:**

| Entity | Purpose | Key Features |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| **Character** | Psychological depth | Goals, values, fears, secrets, behavioral limits, voice profile, relationships, character arc |
| **Location** | Place with rules | Geography, climate, social rules, restrictions, access control, atmosphere |
| **Faction** | Organizations | Interests, resources, allies/enemies, tactics, forbidden actions |
| **MagicRule** | Hard world rules | Laws (immutable), costs, limitations, exceptions, prohibitions |
| **Item** | Significant objects | Properties, limitations, history, ownership, access restrictions |
| **Event** | Timeline entries | Causality (cause→effect), consequences, participants, impact level |
| **Promise** | Narrative setups | Setup description, required payoff, deadline, status (open/fulfilled/abandoned) |
| **Thread** | Story arcs | Type, start/end chapters, tension tracking, milestones, deadlines |
| **StyleProfile** | Prose style | Tempo, sentence structure, vocabulary, tone, literary devices, narrator type |

**Key Canon Features:**
- `claims` (established facts) vs `unknowns` (deliberately undefined)
- Git-like versioning (every change = commit)
- Version history with rollback capability
- Tags for organization
- Validation at entity level

**API Endpoints:** 40+ CRUD endpoints
- `/api/canon/character`, `/api/canon/location`, `/api/canon/promise`, `/api/canon/thread`
- `/api/canon/validate/{entity_type}/{entity_id}`
- `/api/canon/versions/{project_id}`
- `/api/canon/stats/{project_id}`

---

### 2. **Canon Contracts** ⭐ DIFFERENTIATOR

**Hard rules that AI generation MUST respect**

**Features:**
- Define immutable rules (e.g., "Magic always costs blood")
- Three severity levels:
  * **must** - Absolute rule, violations block generation
  * **should** - Strong preference, violations trigger warnings
  * **prefer** - Soft preference, violations logged
- LLM-powered validation of any text
- Suggested fixes for violations
- Rule types: world, character, magic, plot, style
- Examples system for clarity
- Violation tracking and statistics

**API Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/contracts` - Create contract
- `GET /api/contracts?project_id` - List contracts
- `PUT /api/contracts/{id}` - Update contract
- `DELETE /api/contracts/{id}` - Deactivate contract
- `POST /api/contracts/validate` - Validate text
- `POST /api/contracts/validate-chapter` - Chapter validation

**Why It's Unique:**
Competitors (Sudowrite, NovelCrafter) have story bibles but **no hard validation**. This enforces consistency at the rule level.

---

### 3. **Promise/Payoff Ledger** ⭐ DIFFERENTIATOR

**Solves #1 problem in long novels: abandoned promises**

**Features:**
- **Auto-detection** of narrative promises in text:
  * Chekhov's Gun (items that must pay off)
  * Character goals and vows
  * Mysteries and unanswered questions
  * Foreshadowing and prophecies
  * Threats and warnings
- Confidence scoring (0-100)
- Automatic deadline suggestion
- Promise status tracking (open/fulfilled/abandoned)
- **Payoff validation** - ensures payoff actually fulfills promise
- Completeness scoring (0-100)
- Health metrics and warnings
- Overdue detection

**API Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/promises/detect` - Auto-detect promises
- `GET /api/promises/open` - List unfulfilled promises
- `GET /api/promises/near-deadline` - Approaching deadlines
- `GET /api/promises/overdue` - Past deadline
- `POST /api/promises/{id}/validate-payoff` - Validate payoff
- `GET /api/promises/report` - Health report

**Health Scoring:**
- 100 = Perfect (all fulfilled, none overdue)
- Penalties for overdue/abandoned promises
- Warnings for approaching deadlines

**Why It's Unique:**
Automated promise detection + validation is **rare/non-existent** in competing products.

### 4. **Planner Service** - 3-Level Structure

**Level 1: Book Arc**
- Premise and theme
- Three-act structure with configurable breaks

  * Climax
  * Resolution
  * Custom beats support
- Tension curve (target tension per chapter)
- Validation: premise, theme, act logic, beats

**Level 2: Chapters**

- Conflict (what opposes goal)
- Emotional journey (opening → closing emotion)
- Reveals (information/secrets)
- POV character and primary location
- Target word count and tension
- Active threads and promises
- Status: planned → drafted → revised → final
- Validation: goal, conflict, emotional change, word count

**Level 3: Scenes (Scene Cards)**
- Goal, conflict, disaster
- Value shift (entering → exiting)
- What changes (concrete requirement)
- Participants (character IDs)
- Required items and knowledge
- Timing (duration, time of day)
- Generation hints (tone, pacing, focus)
- Validation: goal, change, participants

**API Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/planner/arc` - Create book arc
- `GET /api/planner/arc/{project_id}` - Get arc

### 5. **Quality Control (QC) Service** ⭐ DIFFERENTIATOR

**Multi-agent "writers' room" validation**

**Validation Agents:**

**1. Continuity Editor**
- Timeline consistency (events in order, time logic)
- Location logic (travel times, geography)
- Item tracking (who has what)
- Physical impossibilities

**2. Character Editor**
- Out-of-character behavior
- Voice consistency in dialogue
- Motivation alignment
- Behavioral limits violations

**3. Plot Editor**
- Deus ex machina detection
- Cause and effect logic
- Setup and payoff
- Stakes and consequences

**4. Contract Validator**
- Integration with Canon Contracts
- Must/should/prefer enforcement

**5. Promise Detector**
- Integration with Promise Ledger
- Auto-detect new promises

**QC Report Structure:**
- **Passed:** Boolean (no blockers)
- **Score:** 0-100 quality score
- **Issues:** Categorized by severity
  * Blocker - Must fix before accepting
  * Warning - Should fix
  * Suggestion - Nice to have
- **Breakdown:** Issues by category
- **Detected Promises:** For tracking

**Scoring Algorithm:**
- 100 = Perfect, no issues
- Penalties: blocker (-30), warning (-10), suggestion (-3)
- Minimum 0

**API Endpoint:**
- `POST /api/qc/validate-chapter` - Full validation

**Why It's Unique:**
Multi-agent quality gates **before accepting content** - ensures narrative consistency.
